Modular Real-Time Simulation Framework for PL-15 Missile Training
Introduction
The PL-15 is an advanced long-range, active radar-guided air-to-air missile featuring an AESA radar seeker and dual-pulse motor for beyond-visual-range engagements
armyrecognition.com
. Training and evaluating such a sophisticated missile against diverse aerial targets – from stealth fighters to drones – requires a high-fidelity simulation environment. This report presents a fully modular, physics-based simulation framework in Python, designed around SimPy for discrete-event simulation and capable of real-time or near-real-time execution. The framework models the complete radar and target engagement physics with maximal realism, enabling PL-15 seeker and guidance algorithms to be trained and tested against a spectrum of adversaries (stealth aircraft, UAVs, conventional fighters, etc.). Key goals include a compositional architecture with interchangeable subsystems, real-time simulation speed, detailed RF propagation and radar cross-section (RCS) modeling, and support for AI-driven training (reinforcement learning, scenario automation, and integration of learned behaviors). In the following sections, we outline the system architecture and modules, describe the physics-based signal modeling (radar and signatures), and detail how the framework supports reinforcement learning training and the inclusion of pre-trained models. Example scenarios are provided to illustrate how the PL-15 can be virtually “trained” against different target types under various conditions.
Architecture Overview
Framework Design: The simulation is built as a modular composition of subsystems, each representing a functional component of the missile or its environment. A discrete-event scheduler (SimPy) orchestrates these components over simulated time. By using SimPy’s process-based paradigm, each module (e.g. radar emitter, target aircraft, etc.) can be implemented as a process that yields control to the SimPy Environment scheduler, allowing natural modeling of asynchronous events (radar pulse emissions, target maneuvers, sensor detections, etc.). The design follows a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), treating each subsystem as a plug-and-play module with well-defined interfaces (inputs/outputs)

iastatedigitalpress.com
. This enables interchangeability – for example, swapping out a simple target model for a more complex one – without affecting other parts of the simulation. Such a modular approach greatly improves flexibility, reusability, and extensibility of the framework
iastatedigitalpress.com
. A core “scenario manager” or black-box solver runs the high-level engagement logic by integrating these modules; it uses common physics equations (e.g. the radar range equation) with the input from each module to compute outcomes, iterating over time steps
iastatedigitalpress.com
iastatedigitalpress.com
. The solver and modules communicate through a defined protocol (e.g. Python class interfaces or event messages), ensuring that even though modules are decoupled, the overall system remains synchronized
iastatedigitalpress.com
. Real-Time Execution: The framework supports real-time or faster-than-real-time execution. By default, SimPy runs simulations as fast as possible, but for hardware-in-the-loop or interactive training, a real-time clock sync can be enabled. This is achieved by using SimPy’s RealtimeEnvironment, which advances simulation time in step with wall-clock time
simpy.readthedocs.io
. For example, setting RealtimeEnvironment(factor=1.0) makes 1 simulated second equal 1 real second
simpy.readthedocs.io
. The simulation can be throttled or accelerated by adjusting this factor (e.g. 0.1 to run 10× real speed)
simpy.readthedocs.io
. If strict real-time mode is on, the framework will raise an error if any time-step’s computation exceeds the allotted real time
simpy.readthedocs.io
simpy.readthedocs.io
 – this ensures the simulation remains real-time capable by design. Heavy computations (like detailed physics models) must therefore be optimized or executed in parallel to meet real-time constraints (otherwise strict=False can be set to allow slight overruns
simpy.readthedocs.io
). In practice, achieving near-real-time performance is feasible by calibrating the level of detail in models and possibly leveraging C/C++ optimized libraries for computationally intensive tasks (e.g. using vectorized NumPy/SciPy or offloading certain calculations). The modular design also allows distributing computation; for instance, a radar signal processing module could run on a separate thread or process if needed, feeding results back to the main SimPy loop. Data Flow: At each simulation step or event, the data flow might be as follows: the missile’s radar emitter sends out a pulse (event scheduled) -> the environment module applies propagation effects and determines if/when the pulse hits the target -> the target’s RCS model computes the reflected signal -> the propagation model delivers the return signal plus any clutter/jamming to the missile’s receiver -> the signal processing module processes the received waveform to detect the target. Meanwhile, the target’s own module updates its position (and potentially its countermeasure state) continuously, and a guidance module updates the missile’s flight trajectory based on the seeker’s tracking data. A centralized simulation clock (SimPy env) ensures all these processes advance in sync. This design cleanly separates concerns: each subsystem can be developed and tested in isolation, and then composed for the full engagement simulation. Modularity and Extensibility: Each subsystem is interchangeable – for example, one can plugin a high-fidelity radar model or replace it with a simpler one for faster simulation, as long as it adheres to the interface (e.g., produces detection outputs given truth inputs). This composability means new modules (say, an IR sensor or a different guidance law) can be added without restructuring the whole system. The benefits of such a modular approach include flexibility to configure different scenarios, cost-effectiveness by reusing modules, and ease of maintenance

. It avoids monolithic design that might hard-code specific assumptions; instead, the framework handles a broad range of inputs and outputs, letting users define environment parameters, target types, and component behaviors as needed
iastatedigitalpress.com
iastatedigitalpress.com
. A robust interface protocol (e.g., Python abstract base classes or simple function call contracts) is defined for module interactions to prevent integration issues
iastatedigitalpress.com
. In summary, the architecture provides a template-based simulation environment where the PL-15 missile and various adversary models can co-exist and interact under realistic physics, either in accelerated testing or synchronized real-time for human/Hardware-in-loop exercises.
Component Modules
To satisfy the requirement of a fully modular, compositional system, the framework is divided into discrete subsystem modules. Each module encapsulates a specific aspect of the missile or the scenario, and can be developed or replaced independently. The primary modules in the simulation are:
Radar Emitter/Seeker (Missile Radar): This module represents the PL-15’s active radar seeker – essentially the radar transmitter and receiver on the missile. It handles the emission of radar pulses or waveforms and the reception of echo signals. Key parameters include transmit power, frequency/band (e.g. X-band radar), antenna gain and beamwidth, pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and waveform type (e.g. chirped pulse or continuous wave). This radar is modeled with full physics where possible: it transmits pulses into the simulated environment, which the environment module will propagate and reflect. On receive, the seeker module converts the incoming RF echoes into baseband signals or detection events to feed into the signal processing pipeline. The seeker can be made as detailed as needed – e.g. modeling an AESA radar with electronic beam steering and frequency agility. The module is designed so that one could swap in different seeker models (for example, a simplified range-only radar vs. a full waveform simulator). Input: target reflection signals (from environment). Output: raw radar returns (IQ data or detected range/Doppler measurements). Implementation Note: We could leverage existing radar simulation libraries for realism – e.g. using RadarSimPy to generate baseband radar data from defined targets
github.com
. Indeed, RadarSimPy demonstrates modeling of radar transceivers and baseband signals for both point targets and 3D target models
github.com
, which validates the feasibility of our high-fidelity approach. Our emitter/seeker will similarly be capable of simulating advanced waveforms and even accounting for phase noise or beamforming if needed (those effects can be added modularly).
Radar Signal Processing Pipeline: This module takes the radar seeker’s received signals and processes them to detect and track the target. It represents the missile’s onboard signal processing unit (or an offboard processor if applicable). The pipeline can include stages such as low-noise amplification, filtering and mixing to baseband (if we simulate at RF), pulse compression (matched filtering for chirped pulses), Doppler processing (e.g. FFT to produce range-Doppler maps), constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection to pick out targets from noise/clutter, and tracking filters (e.g. a Kalman filter or alpha-beta tracker) to estimate target motion. We implement this as a modular chain – e.g., one sub-component for detection, one for tracking – so that different algorithms can be plugged in. For example, one could replace a classical CFAR detector with a machine-learning-based detector without affecting other parts. The output of this module is a track file or target state estimate (e.g. target range, velocity, angle as perceived by the missile). Input: raw or baseband radar returns (from the seeker). Output: processed detections or target track (position/velocity) for the guidance system. Key parameters include detection thresholds (P_FA, P_D), signal integration time (coherent pulses per burst), and update rate. This module can simulate realistic limitations like false alarms, missed detections, or limited resolution. It can also model the seeker’s field of view and lock-on range – e.g., if the target RCS is below a detection threshold at long range, the signal processing might report no target until closer (which will naturally emerge from low SNR in the simulation). By keeping this pipeline modular, we ensure that we can update the missile’s signal processing logic (for instance, to test improved filtering algorithms or AI-based classifiers) by swapping out this component.
Missile Flight & Guidance: This module models the kinematics and control of the PL-15 missile in flight. It propagates the missile’s state (position, velocity, orientation) over time, responding to guidance commands. The flight model can range from a simple point-mass model (with acceleration limits) to a high-fidelity 6-DOF aerodynamic model. For near-real-time and training use, a simplified physics model (point mass with drag and turn-rate limits) is often sufficient. The Guidance part of this module computes steering commands to intercept the target – for example, using a Proportional Navigation (PN) law or a more advanced/intercept algorithm. In our design, we allow the guidance law to be swapped or augmented (this is crucial for testing reinforcement learning controllers). The module takes the target’s estimated state (from the radar processing module or datalink) and computes the required acceleration or heading change, which then updates the missile’s trajectory. Input: target information (range/angle or full state), possibly from sensor fusion; and possibly mid-course updates from launch platform. Output: updated missile position/velocity (truth) and its own status (like whether the target is within seeker range, etc.). Key parameters here include the missile’s maximum acceleration (g-load), thrust profile (dual-pulse motor timing), and aerodynamic properties (lift/drag if 6DOF). The guidance component might also incorporate flight control logic – e.g., an autopilot that turns the acceleration command into fin deflections – but this can be abstracted unless high fidelity is needed. By modularizing flight dynamics, one could plug in an alternate model (for example, a high-fidelity missile aerodynamics model for specific analyses, or a point-mass for fast simulations). This module ensures the simulation isn’t just point-in-space engagement but accounts for the missile needing to actually maneuver to the target.
Target Maneuver & Signature: This module represents the adversary target’s movement and signature characteristics. It encapsulates the target aircraft or object that the missile is engaging. The maneuver model updates the target’s position and velocity each time step according to its flight dynamics and any evasion tactics. For example, a fighter jet target might execute high-g maneuvers or defensive turns, whereas a UAV might fly a steady or erratic path, and a bomber might maintain a straight line. We can implement different target types as subclasses or configurations of this module. The target model can include simple kinematics (with predefined maneuver scripts or behaviors) or be driven by an AI agent (for adversarial training, the target could have a policy that reacts to the missile’s actions). Signature modeling: In addition to kinematics, this module holds the target’s radar and possibly infrared signature properties. The radar cross-section (RCS) of the target is modeled here, potentially as a function of aspect angle and frequency. For highest fidelity, a shape-based RCS model can be used – for instance, loading a 3D mesh of the target aircraft and using electromagnetic simulation or lookup tables to get RCS for any look angle. (In practice, one might precompute an RCS vs aspect library using methods like Physical Optics or Method of Moments, and then interpolate during the simulation for real-time speed). Alternatively, simpler models (Swerling target models, or a few discrete scattering centers) can approximate the RCS. This module provides the simulation with the target’s RCS value toward the missile at any given moment, which the environment uses to scale the reflected signal
mwrf.com
. If IR sensors are in play, the module would also provide an IR signature (e.g. engine heat emission, which could be a function of throttle, aspect, etc.). Key parameters: target type (fighter, stealth, UAV, etc.), max speed/acceleration, maneuver logic (perhaps state machines or an embedded policy), base RCS and RCS fluctuation model, and any on-board countermeasures (like if the target deploys flares or chaff, though we treat those under ECM module). Input: potentially commands or triggers (e.g., if external logic dictates an evasive maneuver at a certain time, or if sensor fusion identifies the missile’s approach). Output: target truth state (position/velocity), and signature data (RCS, IR intensity) to the environment. By combining movement and signature, this module fully describes the “target entity” in the scenario. Multiple target modules can be instantiated for scenarios with several adversaries.
Environment & RF Propagation: This module simulates the physical environment and radar wave propagation through it. It is responsible for taking signals from transmitters (e.g. the missile’s radar) and propagating them to receivers (e.g. target echo back to the missile), applying the correct physics. This includes free-space path loss (signal power decays with distance per the radar range equation), time-of-flight delays (finite speed of light), and any environmental attenuation (atmospheric absorption if modeling long-range high-frequency effects). The environment also handles reflections and multipath: for example, if operating at low altitude, radar signals may bounce off the ground – the module can include a simple ground reflection model causing multipath interference at the receiver. Clutter modeling is included here: ground or sea clutter is essentially reflection from the terrain or sea surface within the radar beam. We can model clutter by populating the environment with many small scatterers or by a statistical model. For instance, using a statistical clutter model, the environment module can generate clutter returns with appropriate power distribution for a given terrain type
la.mathworks.com
. If needed, actual terrain elevation data can be loaded so that the module knows where the ground is to simulate multipath and line-of-sight occlusion. Doppler effects are inherently handled by this module as well: it will adjust the frequency (or phase) of reflected signals based on relative velocities (via the Doppler shift formula). Thus, a moving target introduces a Doppler frequency shift in the returned radar signal, which the radar processing module will have to account for. The environment can either directly compute this shift in the signal (if we simulate waveforms) or provide metadata like “Doppler velocity = X m/s” to the processing stage. Jamming and interference (part of ECM) are also applied in the environment: the environment can carry active jammer signals that get superimposed on the radar echoes. In summary, this module is the physics engine connecting emitters and receivers. It takes as input any transmitted signal plus the states of all entities (to know distances, angles, etc.), and produces as output the signals as received by each sensor (missile seeker, any other radar in scene). Key parameters: speed of light (for time calculation), environmental dielectric (if simulating propagation through medium other than vacuum), clutter reflectivity (Radar Cross Section per unit area for ground/sea), and noise temperature (thermal noise level for receivers). The radar range equation is applied here to determine received power: for example, the missile’s radar sees a target echo power P_rx = P_tx * G_tx * G_rx * λ^2 * σ / ((4π)^3 R^4) (monostatic case), where σ is the target RCS and R the range. This fundamental relation is built into the environment’s computations to ensure correct signal amplitudes

. By isolating propagation in this module, we allow easy upgrades (e.g. inserting a more complex atmospheric propagation model or using a different clutter model) without altering other components.
Sensor Fusion & Datalink: This module is responsible for integrating data from multiple sensors or external sources. In many engagements, especially at long range, the missile might receive mid-course updates from the launching platform’s radar (via datalink) before its own seeker locks on. We model this via a datalink component that can feed target track updates to the missile during flight. The sensor fusion logic would take such updates and combine them with the missile’s own seeker data when available. For example, early in the flight, the missile might rely solely on course corrections via datalink (target coordinates provided by the launch aircraft or AWACS); once the missile’s radar acquires the target, the fusion module might blend the two sources or switch to the seeker as the primary source. This module ensures a seamless transition and consistency between different sources of information. It can also fuse multiple sensor modalities – for instance, if we introduced an infrared seeker on the missile or an passive RF sensor, their data could be fused to get a better target picture. Key aspects include coordinate transforms (ensuring all data is in a common frame), filtering to merge tracks, and handling latency (datalink updates may come intermittently). Input: external track data (e.g. via datalink messages with target position/velocity), and missile’s own sensor track. Output: a unified target state estimate to the guidance system. Parameters might involve datalink update rate, latency, and fusion weights or filter time constants. By keeping this separate, one could simulate scenarios with and without external support simply by toggling this module. It also allows testing advanced concepts like cooperative engagement (multiple missiles or sensors sharing data) by expanding the fusion logic.
Electronic Countermeasures (ECM): This module represents the adversary’s countermeasures and the missile’s counter-countermeasures, focusing on electronic warfare in the radar domain (and infrared if applicable). It can be considered a part of the target’s apparatus (since adversaries deploy ECM), but we separate it for modularity. ECM can include noise jamming, deceptive jamming, and deployment of decoys (chaff or flares). In the simulation, the ECM module can inject a jamming signal into the environment. For example, a noise jammer will add a certain power spectral density across the radar’s bandwidth, raising the noise floor seen by the radar – this can be simulated by adding an appropriate noise signal to the receiver input (or simply by reducing the effective SNR in the signal processing module). A deceptive jammer might send false echoes to confuse the radar; we can simulate this by generating fake target detections at different ranges/velocities. Chaff (strips of metallic foil) can be modeled as a cloud of numerous small reflectors released by the target – effectively a transient cluster of high clutter that might create multiple false targets or obscure the real target. The ECM module would handle the timing of chaff release and simulate the resulting clutter RCS bloom. It can also reduce the target’s own RCS if modeling onboard stealth measures (though generally stealth is passive and already accounted in the target’s RCS profile). The missile’s ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) can also be modeled: for instance, the missile’s radar might have frequency-hopping to mitigate jamming, or side-lobe nulling to resist certain jammers. These would be reflected in how the radar processing handles interference – potentially configured in the radar module but informed by tactics in this ECM module. Input: the state of the engagement (e.g. if missile is locking on, target might trigger ECM), possibly messages from target to environment (to inject signals). Output: modifies the signals/environment (jamming injected, decoy deployed) and possibly sends status to other modules (e.g. to sensor fusion that target used ECM). The parameters for ECM include jammer effective radiated power, jammer technique (barrage noise, sweep, false target generator, etc.), and the schedule or triggers for deployment. The framework’s modularity allows testing different ECM techniques by swapping this module or adjusting its parameters – for instance, we can easily toggle a scenario to have heavy jamming vs none. Notably, modern radar simulation toolkits also treat transmitters, propagation channels, targets, jammers, and clutter as distinct components
cesimulations.com
, and our framework mirrors this comprehensive breakdown. By including an ECM module, we ensure the simulation can stress the missile’s seeker with realistic countermeasures, an important aspect of training and robustness evaluation.
These modules and their interactions are summarized in Table 1 below: <table> <tr><th>Subsystem Module</th><th>Role in Simulation</th><th>Key Parameters / Features</th></tr> <tr><td><strong>Radar Emitter/Seeker</strong></td><td>Missile’s active radar; transmits pulses and receives target echoes.</td><td>Frequency band, waveform (e.g. pulse Doppler), antenna gain/pattern, transmit power, receiver sensitivity, beam steering logic.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Signal Processing</strong></td><td>Processes radar returns to detect and track target.</td><td>Pulse integration count, Doppler processing (FFT size), CFAR threshold (P<sub>fa</sub>), tracking filter type (e.g. Kalman), update rate.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Missile Flight & Guidance</strong></td><td>Propagates missile kinematics and computes guidance commands.</td><td>Max turn acceleration (g), speed/drag, guidance law (PN, AI policy), autopilot response time, dual-pulse motor timing.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Target Maneuver & Signature</strong></td><td>Propagates target motion; provides target’s RCS/IR signature.</td><td>Target type (stealth fighter, UAV, etc.), maneuver logic (evasive pattern or AI), RCS vs angle (possibly table or model), RCS fluctuation model (Swerling type), IR output (if needed).</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Environment & Propagation</strong></td><td>Simulates RF propagation, path loss, multipath, and clutter; delivers signals from transmitter to receiver.</td><td>Free-space loss model (radar range eq.), atmospheric attenuation, terrain model for clutter, noise temperature, propagation delay calculation.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Sensor Fusion & Datalink</strong></td><td>Fuses missile seeker data with external sensor inputs (mid-course updates).</td><td>Datalink update interval and latency, fusion filter (e.g. α-β filter or Kalman), coordinate frames transformation, handover logic (when seeker takes over tracking).</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Electronic Countermeasures</strong></td><td>Simulates jamming and decoys affecting the missile’s sensors.</td><td>Jammer type (noise/deception), jammer power and frequency band, chaff deployment timing and RCS, ECCM techniques (frequency hopping, filtering algorithms).</td></tr> </table> Table 1: Key modules in the PL-15 simulation framework, with their roles and representative parameters. Each module can be developed and tuned independently, and communicates with others through defined interfaces (e.g. passing target states, sensor readings, or signal data structures). This high-level separation aligns with established radar simulation toolkits that include models for transmitters, propagation channels, targets, clutter, and jammers
cesimulations.com
. By designing the simulation in terms of these modules, we fulfill the compositional requirement: one can mix-and-match different implementations for any subsystem. For instance, to simulate a stealth target, one would plug in a Target module with a very low RCS profile and perhaps an aggressive ECM module, without changing anything in the Radar or Guidance modules. To test a new guidance law, one swaps the Guidance sub-module (or feeds it with a learned neural network controller) and the rest of the simulation remains the same. This modular breakdown also makes the system easier to maintain and upgrade – new features (like adding an IR sensor, or a new type of clutter model) can be added as new modules or extensions, rather than rewriting a monolithic codebase.
Physics-Based Radar and Signature Modeling
One of the core goals of this framework is highest physical accuracy in modeling radar-target interactions. We achieve this through rigorous physics-based models for signal propagation, target signatures, and environmental effects. Below we detail how the simulation handles radar signals and target signatures (RCS and IR) with physical realism: Radar Cross-Section (RCS) Modeling: The RCS of a target is a measure of how detectable it is by radar – it depends on the target’s shape, size, materials, and aspect angle relative to the radar. In our simulation, the Target module provides a dynamic RCS value for each radar query. For conventional aircraft, RCS can vary with aspect (for example, a fighter jet might have a larger RCS side-on than head-on). We implement a shape-based RCS computation by using either analytical shapes or empirical data. One approach is to break the target into simple scatterers: for instance, approximate an aircraft by a combination of flat plates and cylinders and compute each component’s RCS contribution. Another approach is using precomputed RCS lookup tables: for a given target model (say an F-16 or a stealth drone), one can use electromagnetic simulation software offline to generate RCS vs angle data, then import that into our simulation. This allows full physics accuracy (accounting for diffraction, multi-bounce, etc.) without the heavy computation during runtime, since during the simulation we just interpolate the table. If such data is not available, we can use canonical formulas (RCS of a sphere, cone, flat plate) or the Swerling target models for statistical RCS fluctuations
mwrf.com
. The Swerling models I-IV characterize how a target’s RCS might fluctuate pulse-to-pulse or scan-to-scan (e.g., Swerling I/II assume exponential distribution of RCS with certain correlation properties)
mwrf.com
. We could assign, for example, a Swerling I model for a jet (fluctuating slowly per scan) or Swerling III for a more fluctuating target, to simulate glint and scintillation effects. This means in some frames the target might appear with a slightly different RCS, affecting detection probability. By adopting these models, we ensure our simulation reflects real radar behavior where target returns are not constant
mwrf.com
. Indeed, we can even validate our RCS modeling approach against known references – e.g., RadarSimPy allows characterizing radar detection using Swerling’s models as well
github.com
. It’s worth noting that stealth targets will have RCS values orders of magnitude smaller than regular aircraft
en.wikipedia.org
. For example, a stealth fighter might have an RCS on the order of 0.01 m² or less, compared to several m² for a conventional fighter – our target module can reflect this by using an extremely low RCS input. The effect on detection range can be dramatic: since radar detection range scales with the fourth root of RCS (per the radar range equation), a reduction of RCS by 10,000× yields about a 10× reduction in detection range
en.wikipedia.org
. The simulation captures this relationship explicitly. Thus, when the PL-15 is up against a stealthy adversary, our physics-based model will naturally cause the missile’s radar to only pick up the target at much shorter ranges (or perhaps struggle to track it at all in heavy noise/clutter) – a critical aspect for training engagement tactics. RF Propagation and Radar Equation: The environment module uses the radar range equation to compute received power at the missile’s radar from the target. In a simplified monostatic scenario, $P_{rx} = P_{tx} G_{tx} G_{rx} \frac{\lambda^2}{(4\pi)^3 R^4} \sigma$, where $P_{tx}$ is transmit power, $G_{tx}, G_{rx}$ are antenna gains (which could be combined for an active seeker on the missile), $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $R$ the range, and $\sigma$ the RCS. This equation is evaluated continuously (or for each pulse) to determine the signal strength arriving at the receiver. If there are multiple propagation paths (multipath), the environment might compute multiple contributions and sum them (possibly with phase, if simulating interference). For example, a direct path and a ground-reflected path might arrive out of phase and partially cancel, causing fading. Indeed, even multiple scattering centers on the target itself can lead to interference nulls in RCS vs angle (deep fades)
mwrf.com
, which our model can replicate by having a multi-scatterer target representation. The propagation model also adds thermal noise to the received signal based on a noise temperature and bandwidth. This produces a realistic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the radar returns, which feeds into detection probability. We can verify that our signal power and noise calculations align with known results by generating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves – e.g., using tools like RadarSimPy’s built-in SNR to detection probability functions
radarsimx.github.io
radarsimx.github.io
. Doppler Shift and Moving Target Indication: Because both the missile and target may be moving at high speeds (missile could be Mach 4+, target maybe Mach 1), Doppler effects are important. The environment module computes the relative radial velocity between the missile’s radar and the target. Using the Doppler formula $f_d = \frac{2 v_r}{\lambda}$ for monostatic radar, it shifts the phase/frequency of the returned signal accordingly. In practice, if we are not simulating the full waveform, the environment can output a parameter for the signal processing module like “Doppler velocity = X m/s” or directly generate the appropriate beat frequency in an FMCW scenario. Our simulation can produce range-Doppler maps if we simulate multiple pulses: for instance, if we accumulate the complex returns over a burst, we could take an FFT to get the range-Doppler plot akin to real radar data. This level of detail might be used for algorithm development or machine learning (where having simulated IQ data is useful). If performance is a concern, a simpler approach is to analytically determine if a target would be separated from clutter in Doppler – e.g., in look-down engagements, stationary ground clutter appears near 0 Doppler, whereas a moving target has a non-zero Doppler. Our model could mark returns with their Doppler and let the signal processor decide if it is filterable. Multipath and Clutter: We simulate multipath by considering reflections off the ground or other surfaces. For simplicity, we could assume a flat earth with a certain reflectivity. The environment would then create a second “image” of the target at a mirrored position below the ground, with some reflection coefficient, contributing an echo. This can cause constructive or destructive interference at the receiver. Clutter is treated as many tiny reflectors spread across the illuminated ground patch. We might implement this by generating a random clutter power level per radar resolution cell based on statistical models (Rayleigh or log-normal distribution for clutter amplitude). Tools like MATLAB’s Radar Toolbox approach clutter by defining surface RCS and generating clutter detections accordingly
la.mathworks.com
la.mathworks.com
. We mimic this: for a given area (like terrain under the target or around it), generate a number of clutter points that produce returns. If the radar has side lobes, clutter could also come from those (we may assume mainlobe-only for simplicity unless high fidelity side-lobe modeling is needed). Importantly, clutter and multipath primarily affect low-altitude engagements; the framework can toggle these effects based on scenario (e.g., enable ground clutter when target altitude < X). Weather clutter (rain, chaff clouds) can also be introduced similarly by adding scattering particles in the environment. Jamming and Interference: Active jamming signals are generated by the ECM module and propagated by the environment to the missile. A noise jammer might be represented as an additive white Gaussian noise added to the receiver input with a power level such that the jammer-to-signal ratio matches a desired value at the radar. We compute how much power the jammer would deliver to the missile: using a radar equation variant for jammer-to-signal ratio (the burn-through range can be estimated by comparing jammer ERP and target RCS). In the sim, if the jammer is very strong, the signal processing module may see the noise floor raised, leading to reduced detection range or lost lock. A deceptive jammer could be more complex: one strategy is range gate pull-off – where the jammer initially echoes the radar’s signal with the correct delay to appear as the true target, then gradually delays or advances the false signal to drag the tracker off target. We can simulate this by introducing a fake target echo in the environment with whatever delay/velocity the jammer dictates. Our ECM module would control this fake echo’s parameters over time to confuse the tracking filter. The missile’s radar might have countermeasures like frequency agility to counter repeaters (the sim can change frequency per pulse and require the jammer to keep up – if not, the false echo strength diminishes). All these intricate interactions are possible to simulate due to our modular approach: the ECM module creates interference, the environment carries it, and the radar processing module either fails or succeeds to handle it, allowing us to evaluate the missile’s ECCM performance. Infrared Signature (optional): Although the PL-15 is primarily radar-guided, our framework is extensible to infrared (IR) signatures if needed (for instance, to simulate a dual-mode seeker or to model an IRST system on the launching platform). The IR signature of an aircraft is determined by factors like engine exhaust plumes, heated surfaces, and altitude (background sky vs ground contrast). A physics-based IR model would compute the target’s thermal emissions (using blackbody radiation approximations for exhaust, maybe at a few micron wavelength bands) and then apply atmospheric transmission losses. In a high-fidelity mode, one could integrate a tool like MuSES or OKTAL-SE (which are used for IR scene simulation) – but those are outside Python scope. Instead, we can approximate IR detection range by a simpler model: treat the target as an IR point source of a certain intensity, and use an IR detection equation (analogous to radar equation but with radiative intensity and a sensor NETD noise-equivalent temperature). If included, the IR sensor would be another module and the target module would provide an IR signature value (perhaps proportional to throttle or a fixed value representing a hot engine). Since IR effects were mentioned, our design can accommodate it, but it can be toggled off for pure radar training to save computation. In sum, the signal modeling in our simulation is rooted in real physics equations and models: free-space propagation, radar cross-section, Doppler shift, clutter, noise, jamming are all accounted for. We favor approaches that yield high accuracy while remaining computationally feasible for real-time. Where needed, we leverage statistical models (like Swerling RCS fluctuations, clutter distributions) to emulate complex physical phenomena without having to solve Maxwell’s equations on the fly (which would be impractical in real-time)

. The result is a simulation that produces sensor data nearly as complex and realistic as what the actual PL-15 missile would see in various scenarios. This “synthetic reality” is vital for training AI models and testing algorithms, as it ensures that any learned behavior or tested logic will transfer to real-world conditions because the underlying physics have been faithfully represented.
Reinforcement Learning Integration
A central motivation for this simulation framework is to enable reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning training for the missile’s guidance and tactics. We have designed the framework to function as a learning environment, providing all the hooks needed for training agents (either the missile’s guidance or the target’s evasive controller). Here’s how the integration is achieved: OpenAI Gym Interface: The modular design is compatible with the typical OpenAI Gym environment style, where at each time step the environment returns an observation and a reward, and the agent (controller) supplies an action. We can wrap the entire simulation in a Gym-like API – for example, the action could be a guidance command (if training the missile’s brain) or an evasive maneuver (if training a target evasion policy), and the observation would include the missile’s sensor readings or the state of the engagement (distance to target, etc.), depending on the point of view. Using SimPy, we can still step the simulation in discrete time increments (e.g., 0.1 seconds per step) or event-driven intervals and synchronize with the agent decisions. Notably, prior research has successfully combined SimPy with OpenAI Gym for training RL agents
arxiv.org
, so we leverage similar methodologies for seamless integration. Each episode in RL corresponds to a simulation run from launch until termination (target hit or missile runs out of energy, etc.). The reward function can be shaped for the task: e.g., a positive reward for hitting the target or reducing miss distance, small negative rewards each time step to encourage faster interception, and penalties for losing track of the target. By running many simulated episodes with randomized scenarios, an RL algorithm can learn an optimal guidance policy. Truth-Based Adversarial Behavior: Since we have full access to the “ground truth” of the simulation (we know the exact states of missile and target at all times), we can use this to drive adversarial behaviors in a controlled way. For instance, the target’s Maneuver module could be governed by an adversarial policy that knows the missile’s relative position and tries to maximize miss distance or confuse the seeker. This policy could itself be an RL agent (trained perhaps against a basic missile model initially – a form of red-team AI). The simulation thus can host a two-agent game: the missile guidance vs. the target evasion, each trying to outsmart the other. During training, one side can be the learning agent while the other is a fixed pretrained policy, and they can be alternated or co-evolved over time. The “truth-based” aspect means the adversary’s behavior can use ground truth for optimal evasion (for example, it might know when the missile’s seeker has locked on or what the missile’s current velocity is – information a real pilot might infer but we can provide precisely to an AI adversary). This creates a very challenging opponent, pushing the missile’s AI to improve. We ensure, however, that the missile’s own decisions are based only on realistic observations (its radar readings, etc.), not raw truth, to avoid giving it an unfair advantage; this way any learned guidance policy is using information it would actually have in the field. Curriculum Learning & Scenario Management: The framework supports curriculum learning by allowing incremental difficulty ramp-up. Initially, one might train the missile’s guidance on easy targets – e.g., a non-maneuvering target with no jamming. This can be configured by simply choosing a target module with zero maneuvers and no ECM. As the agent improves, the training script can introduce harder scenarios (randomly or in phases): e.g., moderate maneuvers, then full evasive maneuvers, then stealthier targets, then targets with jammers. Because all these features are modular flags or module swaps, a curriculum schedule can programmatically modify the environment each training iteration or phase. For instance, in phase 1, set target RCS high (easy to detect) and no clutter; by phase N, use low RCS, heavy clutter, and aggressive jamming. The reinforcement learning agent thus experiences a progression of challenges. Our simulation can be reset to a new random scenario each episode, sampling from a distribution that gradually shifts to harder conditions. This ensures the learned policy remains robust across the entire range of adversaries. Automated Data Logging and Labeling: During simulation, we log every relevant variable (positions, velocities, sensor detections, actions taken, etc.) with time stamps. This yields a rich dataset for offline analysis or supervised learning. For example, we can automatically label outcomes like “missile hit” or “miss distance” at end of each run, or even label intermediate events (like “target detected at 20 km” or “missile went autonomous at X time”). These logs can be used to train auxiliary models – perhaps a neural network that predicts the probability of hit given certain initial conditions, or to analyze failure cases in a confusion matrix. The framework’s ability to auto-label comes from having ground truth: we know exactly when the missile’s distance to target went below lethal radius, so we label a hit event; we know the target type, so we can label the difficulty. This automated labeling is extremely useful for deep learning pipelines, as it removes manual intervention and ensures consistency. It aligns with practices in synthetic data generation for AI – for instance, MATLAB’s Radar Toolbox notes that one can simulate radar signals and automatically label them for training machine learning models
cesimulations.com
. Our system does the same: every generated radar return can carry a label (target present/absent, target class, etc.) not visible to the missile but available in the logs for supervised learning development. Real-Time Training Loop: Although training is usually done faster than real-time, there are cases where real-time training or hardware in loop training is desired (for example, testing an AI in a realistic pilot-in-the-loop simulation). Thanks to SimPy’s real-time mode, we can run the simulation in sync with wall-clock and interface with external systems (e.g., a cockpit simulator or a live flight computer). The architecture can thus support not just offline learning but also interactive scenarios where a human or external AI controls one side (say, a pilot controlling the target aircraft in a simulator) and our missile guidance AI controls the missile in our simulation, both running in real-time together. This flexibility broadens the utility from pure RL training to also tactics development and operator training. Example – Training an RL Guidance Law: To illustrate, suppose we want to use deep reinforcement learning to develop a new guidance law for the PL-15 that outperforms traditional proportional navigation. We would set up the simulation such that at each decision step, the agent (missile guidance neural network) chooses a heading change or acceleration command. The observation fed to the agent could be a vector containing the relative range, angle, closing velocity, and possibly seeker status (locked or not), and maybe history of maneuvers. Each episode, a target with random initial conditions (distance, angle, maybe random evasive strategy) is spawned. The episode runs until interception or timeout. The reward might be +100 for a successful hit, 0 for a timeout (miss), and we might give small negative rewards for large control inputs to encourage efficient flight. Over many episodes, the agent will try maneuvers and learn from trial and error. Because the simulation is high-fidelity, the agent must learn to deal with real-world complications: the target might disappear in clutter or the missile may lose lock if it turns too aggressively (causing the target to go out of the seeker’s field of view), etc. This complexity is a feature, not a bug – simpler environments often assume perfect information or point-mass interception, but here the agent must concurrently manage the seeker’s constraints and kinematics. This approach has been examined in research and shows promise: recent studies found that RL-based guidance laws can exhibit greater robustness than classical guidance, handling non-linearities and uncertainties better
mdpi.com
. Our simulation allows confirming such findings. We could, for instance, replicate scenarios from literature – one paper used deep RL (DDPG) for missile terminal guidance and achieved improved intercept performance in noisy environments
mdpi.com
. We expect a trained guidance agent in our environment to similarly discover strategies that, say, maintain radar lock (by not turning the seeker away too much) and lead the target optimally. During training, we might observe the agent initially zig-zagging or losing the target (exploring), but eventually converging to a near-optimal policy that consistently guides the missile to intercept. 

Figure 1: Schematic of an RL-integrated missile simulation (adapted from an RL guidance study). The Actor Network (a neural policy) takes missile state or observations (such as relative velocity $V_m$ and line-of-sight angle $\Omega$) and outputs a command $a_c$ (e.g., desired turn rate). The Controller Model (which could be an autopilot or guidance law interface) converts this into an action $a_m$ applied in the Missile Environment (updating the missile’s trajectory). The missile’s Seeker Simulation then provides updated observations (e.g., new LOS angle, range, etc.) closing the loop. This modular insertion of an RL policy in place of a traditional guidance law is made possible by the framework’s design, and it allows training and evaluating the policy in closed-loop with high-fidelity missile and sensor dynamics.

 In the figure above, one can see how our modular components map to an RL loop: the “Missile Environment” corresponds to the physics of flight and target interaction, the “Seeker Simulation” provides the missile’s sensor readings (which form the observation to the RL agent), the “Controller Model” is effectively the interface between the agent’s output and the missile (ensuring the commanded acceleration is achievable, for example), and the “Actor Network” is the learned guidance policy. We emphasize that this entire loop runs within the SimPy-driven simulation, which can be stepped in fine time increments to allow the neural network to make frequent decisions (e.g., 10 Hz or faster). The framework can thus train or host an inference of a neural guidance law in real-time. Beyond guidance, one could also train the target’s evasive maneuvers using RL in our simulation. For example, a hierarchical RL approach could be used where a low-level agent handles basic maneuvers (fly straight, turn, dive) and a high-level agent decides when to evade or not – akin to what Yan et al. (2022) did by training a two-layer RL system for combined missile guidance and evasion
nature.com
nature.com
. In our case, we could train a target agent to maximize miss distance or to spoof the missile’s tracker (for instance, learning when to turn on jamming or release chaff for best effect). This would create an increasingly “intelligent” adversary. Our framework’s ability to incorporate pre-trained models (discussed next) means we could plug these learned behaviors back into the simulation for continued testing. In summary, the simulation environment is tailored for AI-driven experimentation: it is sufficiently realistic to trust that an RL policy trained here will work in practice, and it’s flexible enough to support various learning paradigms (self-play between missile and target agents, curriculum learning, etc.). By logging every detail and providing ground truth when needed, we also ensure the training process can be closely monitored and the results verified or used in supplementary supervised learning tasks.
Integration of Pretrained Models for Behavior Optimization
The modular design of our framework makes it straightforward to integrate pretrained machine learning models into any part of the simulation, enabling what-if analyses and enhancement of subsystem behaviors. We provide guidance on how to incorporate such models: Plug-in Points: A pretrained model (for example, a neural network policy or a surrogate model) can replace or augment the logic in several modules: (1) the Guidance module (to provide control commands based on state), (2) the Target Maneuver module (to dictate adversary tactics), (3) the Signal Processing module (e.g., using a CNN to classify targets from radar returns), or even (4) the ECM module (an AI that decides when to jam). Each of these modules has a clear interface, so a model can be wrapped in a class that adheres to that interface. For instance, the Guidance interface might be compute_acceleration(target_state) -> command. A pretrained PyTorch or TensorFlow model that was trained for guidance can be loaded and its forward call wired to this function. Because our simulation loop is in Python, calling a neural network model is natural (just another function call) – one needs to ensure it’s efficient enough for real-time (most models can run in microseconds to milliseconds, which is fine for step sizes on the order of 0.01s or more). Behavior Optimization via Pretrained Policies: Suppose we have a pretrained evasive maneuver policy for the target (maybe obtained via prior RL training in a simpler environment). We can integrate this into the target’s maneuver module so that at each time step, instead of executing a fixed pattern, the target queries the neural policy with the current state (perhaps relative positions of missile and target) and receives a maneuver decision (e.g., turn left, release chaff, etc.). This allows testing that policy against the missile. Conversely, if the missile’s guidance is a pretrained model, we load it into the missile Guidance module. The rest of the environment can remain high-fidelity; we’re essentially putting an AI brain into the missile and seeing how it performs under various conditions. This approach was exemplified in the hierarchical guidance study by Yan et al.: they trained low-level guidance and evasion agents in isolation (simple scenarios) and then embedded them in a higher-level system for a complex task
nature.com
. We can do similarly – a low-level model (say, one that outputs an optimal turning angle given ideal info) could be plugged in and then higher-level logic can manage when to use it. Interface and Tools: We provide template code that shows how to load a model (from a file, e.g. a .pt PyTorch model or an ONNX model for framework independence) and how to convert simulation state into model input. For example, if a model was trained in a normalized environment (with distances scaled between 0 and 1), we apply the same normalization to the state before feeding it. The output of the model (like a desired turn rate) may also need scaling to the physical limits of the missile (which our Guidance module can enforce). The key is that the model is treated as a black-box function inside the module’s step function. As long as the model’s computation is fast enough, the rest of the SimPy event scheduling is unaffected. If using very large neural networks, one might batch decisions or use a GPU, but typical control policies are small networks. Pretrained Perception Models: Aside from control policies, one might integrate a pre-trained signal classifier. For instance, perhaps one has a convolutional neural network trained to identify if a target is stealthy or not from the radar returns. This could be plugged into the Signal Processing module to extend its capability (maybe to adjust tracking behavior if it suspects a low-RCS target). Similarly, a pretrained sensor fusion neural net (trained on simulation data to optimally combine radar and IR measurements) could replace a traditional filter in the Sensor Fusion module. Validation and Fine-Tuning: Once a pretrained model is in the loop, the simulation can be used to fine-tune it further. Because we can simulate edge cases that might not have been seen in the model’s original training, we can run new scenarios and, if needed, continue training the model (either via on-policy RL fine-tuning or supervised learning on the new data). The framework can generate labeled outcomes to evaluate the model’s performance. For example, if a pretrained guidance law tends to overshoot at high altitude, we can observe that in the simulation and then adjust the model or add training examples to correct it. This iterative approach is facilitated by how easily we can swap the model in/out – we could even have a fallback to a classical guidance law if the model outputs something erratic (safety measures during testing). Integration Example: Suppose an upgraded PL-15 has a pretrained neural network autopilot (trained via deep learning to mimic optimal control). To integrate this, we disable the default PN guidance and instead call the network each time step with the current line-of-sight angle and range-rate, and it returns an aimpoint or acceleration. We then feed that to the missile dynamics. We could monitor how often this network saturates the missile’s capabilities or if it ever issues impossible commands – since we have full insight, we could log those occurrences. If problems are found, the model can be refined offline and re-loaded. In this way, the simulation serves as a testing and optimization ground for AI models in a realistic setting. Sensor Models for AI Training: Additionally, integrating pretrained models isn’t only about control; it can also be about making the simulation more realistic for AI perception. For example, we might integrate a pretrained radar signal simulator (perhaps a GAN-based model that generates realistic clutter patterns) into the Environment module to produce even more life-like inputs for a deep learning algorithm to train on. The modular approach means we can turn on such enhancements when needed (for instance, when specifically focusing on training a neural net to recognize targets in heavy clutter, we might use a learned clutter generator to stress-test it). In summary, any component that can benefit from learned behavior can seamlessly incorporate it in our framework. The design intentionally separates what a module should do from how it does it – the how can be via classical equations or via a neural network or any external model. By providing clear integration points and maintaining real-time performance, the framework acts as a bridge between physics-based simulation and AI-driven optimization. Users can continuously cycle between simulation and machine learning: generate data, train model, embed model, evaluate in sim, and back again. This aligns with modern development of intelligent systems, ensuring the PL-15 and its tactics can be improved using the latest AI techniques, all validated within a high-fidelity simulator before any real-world trial.
Example Scenarios and Usage
To illustrate the capability of the simulation framework, consider a few representative engagement scenarios. These scenarios demonstrate how different adversary types and tactics are configured in the simulation and how the PL-15 (with potentially learned guidance) would be trained/tested in each:
Scenario 1: Stealth Fighter Adversary (High-end Threat) – Target: A fifth-generation stealth aircraft (modeled after an F-35 or J-20). Configuration: The Target module is set with an extremely low RCS profile (orders of magnitude below a conventional aircraft)
en.wikipedia.org
, especially head-on. The target likely does not use much jamming (stealth relies on passive low observability), but it may perform aggressive post-detection maneuvers. We enable ground clutter as the engagement might be at medium altitude with some land clutter. Challenge: The missile’s radar will struggle to get a firm lock until close. This tests the simulation’s high-fidelity RCS modeling – the missile might receive only intermittent detections (low SNR) and could lose the target in clutter. The missile’s guidance (if RL-based) would learn to approach to a closer range or from an angle that maximizes target RCS (e.g., try to climb above the target to look at its less stealthy underside). The simulation allows evaluating tactics like using datalink updates longer (since the seeker might go active late) and how the missile deals with a late seeker activation. A successful outcome is a hit, but in many runs we’d expect close misses if the missile doesn’t close the gap quickly. This scenario validates that the framework can simulate an engagement where detection range is drastically reduced due to stealth – a crucial case for modern air combat.
Scenario 2: UAV Swarm or Cruise Missile (Low RCS, Low Altitude) – Target: A small UAV or cruise missile, possibly one of a swarm. Configuration: The Target module has a small RCS (like 0.01–0.1 m²) and flies at low altitude (introducing strong ground clutter). It maneuvers modestly (UAVs are not very agile, but can weave or change altitude slowly). There may be multiple such targets simulated simultaneously to mimic a swarm (the framework supports multiple target instances). ECM is minimal (UAVs typically don’t carry jammers), but the sheer number of targets can act as confusion – effectively, multiple returns and clutter. Challenge: The missile’s radar must pick the correct target out of the clutter and possibly multiple contacts. Our sensor fusion could be used here if an AWACS or fighter radar is helping to discriminate the real threat. The simulation will produce lots of clutter returns due to low altitude; the signal processing module’s CFAR logic will be stressed. If an RL agent controls the missile, it might learn to loft the missile (gain altitude) for a better radar look-down angle, or to prioritize certain targets (maybe the leading one). We can measure metrics like how many targets are intercepted when facing a salvo of 5 UAVs, etc. This scenario shows how the environment and target modules handle multiple entities and clutter, and how the missile can be trained in target selection and engagement priorities.
Scenario 3: Conventional 4th-Gen Fighter with ECM (Mid-tier Threat) – Target: A non-stealthy fighter (like a MiG-29 or F-16 class), with a relatively larger RCS and equipped with a jammer and chaff. Configuration: The Target module might have an RCS ~5 m² head-on (much larger than the stealth case, so detection is easy at long range). The ECM module is active: as soon as the missile is detected (perhaps when the missile goes active or if the launching platform’s radar is painting the target), the target turns on a noise jammer. Additionally, in the terminal phase, the target will release chaff decoys. The target performs high-g turns to attempt to defeat the missile’s lead pursuit. Challenge: Here the missile’s seeker has a strong initial signal (big RCS) but then has to contend with jamming – the noise might reduce its detection range or break lock. Our simulation will show the effect of the jammer by injecting noise; we can vary jammer power to find the “burn-through” point (the range at which the missile’s radar can see through the jamming). When chaff is deployed, the environment will simulate multiple false targets cluttering the radar screen. The missile’s tracking algorithm might erroneously lock onto a chaff cloud. An RL-guidance agent would have to learn not to be baited by sudden new targets (perhaps maintaining pursuit of the primary target by estimating it might have moved aside). The scenario is successful if the missile can maintain lock and hit despite the countermeasures. We can analyze miss distance distribution with and without ECM to quantify its impact. This scenario uses all aspects of the framework: the RCS is moderate (not too hard), the propagation is standard, but ECM and maneuvers are in play – a very realistic combat scenario.
Scenario 4: Head-on High-Speed Target (Missile vs Missile) – Target: Perhaps an incoming anti-air missile or a superfast drone, to test extreme closing speeds. Configuration: Both missile and target approach each other at high speed. RCS of the target might be small (missiles are smaller), and there’s no jamming (assume the incoming missile doesn’t jam). Challenge: High closure rate means very little time to react – this scenario stresses the real-time capability and the simulation’s time-step resolution. We’d use small time steps (high update frequency) to accurately simulate the intercept. The seeker must quickly acquire and the guidance must execute aggressive maneuvers. This scenario is about stressing timing and the guidance law in a high-speed geometry. The simulation can output whether a head-on collision is achieved or if not, how close it came. This is more of a pure physics test scenario but demonstrates the framework can handle multiple high-speed objects and rapid event sequencing.
These scenarios, summarized in Table 2, show different facets of the training environment: <table> <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Target Type & Behavior</th><th>Notable Simulation Elements</th><th>Training Focus</th></tr> <tr><td><strong>Stealth Fighter</strong><br/>(e.g. J-20)</td><td>Very low RCS (stealth shaping, RCS ≪ 1 m²). High agility maneuvers. Minimal active ECM (relies on stealth).</td><td>Radar detection greatly delayed – missile must fly towards predicted area. Clutter if low altitude. Possibly need datalink updates till terminal phase.</td><td>Seeker sensitivity, late lock-on tactics, handling intermittent contact. RL agent learns to optimize intercept under poor sensor data conditions.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>UAV Swarm</strong><br/>(small drones)</td><td>Small RCS targets (~0.01–0.1 m² each). Multiple slow targets, possibly loitering or moving unpredictably. No jamming.</td><td>Heavy ground clutter (low altitude). Multiple targets cause false alarms/confusion. Each UAV is easy to kill if isolated, but swarm presents target prioritization problem.</td><td>Multi-target tracking, clutter rejection. Guidance might learn to go after closest/highest priority target. Evaluate missile Pk (kill probability) against many small targets.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Conventional Fighter w/ ECM</strong><br/>(e.g. F-16 + jammer)</td><td>Moderate RCS (~5 m²). Performs defensive maneuvers (turns, dives). Uses noise jammer and chaff decoys when engaged.</td><td>Early detection (no stealth). Mid-course jamming degrades SNR. Chaff creates ghost targets in terminal phase. Missile’s ECCM tested (frequency agility, re-acquisition logic).</td><td>Robust tracking in presence of ECM. RL guidance learns not to be fooled by chaff (perhaps via timing or pattern recognition). Evaluating at what jammer power missile fails (jamming burn-through analysis).</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>High-Speed Head-on</strong><br/>(missile vs missile)</td><td>Small RCS (~0.1 m²) but coming straight at missile. Extremely high closure rate (> Mach 5 combined). No countermeasures.</td><td>Very short engagement timeline. Requires high update rates. Possibly radar clutter not an issue (high altitude clear environment). Emphasizes precision in timing and control.</td><td>Test guidance precision and reaction time. Good for validating real-time performance of sim. Could train an agent to maximize probability of head-on kill (learn to aim for collision point).</td></tr> </table> Table 2: Example engagement scenarios configured in the simulation. Each scenario stresses different modules: stealth stresses the sensor physics and low SNR tracking, the UAV swarm stresses multi-target handling and clutter, the conventional fighter with ECM stresses electronic warfare modeling, and the high-speed head-on case stresses the guidance and timing. Through these scenarios, users can employ the framework to both train the missile’s control policies and test/evaluate performance across conditions. For instance, one could train an RL agent across all scenarios mixed randomly to create a very generalized guidance law. The simulation would automatically provide labeled outcomes for each run (hit/miss, etc.), allowing after-action review. If the missile consistently fails in one scenario (say, stealth with heavy jamming), engineers can analyze the logs, adjust the missile’s algorithm (or provide additional sensor capability in the sim), and try again – an iterative design optimization loop facilitated by the simulation. Finally, beyond missile training, the framework serves as a analysis tool: it can output detailed metrics like detection range distributions, track continuity, miss distance statistics, etc., under each scenario. This allows validation of requirements (e.g., “missile must have ≥90% single-shot kill probability against target type X”). Because the simulation is high-fidelity, these metrics carry weight in predicting real-world performance, thereby guiding development before expensive live-fire tests.
Conclusion
We have designed a comprehensive Python-based simulation framework for PL-15 missile training that marries high-fidelity physics with modular flexibility. The use of SimPy for event-driven timing, along with carefully separated subsystems (radar, guidance, target, environment, ECM, etc.), ensures that the simulation can capture the complex interactions of an air combat engagement in real or accelerated time. By incorporating detailed radar signal modeling (including RCS, Doppler, clutter, jamming) and realistic target and environment behaviors, the simulator produces an arena where both human engineers and AI algorithms can safely explore tactics and optimizations. The framework explicitly supports reinforcement learning and AI integration: scenarios can be procedurally varied for training, and learned AI policies can be plugged into the missile or adversary to push the envelope of performance. This modular real-time simulation will enable iterative development of the PL-15’s seeker algorithms and guidance laws – from validating basic operation against simple targets, to honing advanced strategies against the toughest stealthy, ECM-equipped opponents. Through extensive simulated trials and AI-driven improvements, the PL-15 missile system can be trained and validated to ensure high effectiveness in all envisioned combat situations, all within a cost-effective and controllable virtual environment. The approach exemplifies how modern simulation and AI techniques together can significantly enhance the development and readiness of advanced missile systems before they ever face actual conflict.

To fully implement the modular PL-15 simulation system in Python, could you confirm a few things so I can generate the complete code structure efficiently:

Should the implementation prioritize clean modular class structure (e.g. using Python OOP with separate files/modules), or a single-file script for easier review?

Signal Processing Pipeline Module
This module processes the raw radar returns to detect and track the target. It applies threshold detection (e.g., Constant False Alarm Rate filtering) and can include clutter filtering and Doppler processing. For simplicity, we implement threshold detection based on SNR and output the target's measured range and radial velocity if detection occurs. This module would be responsible for rejecting clutter and false alarms, and for providing a stable track of the target for guidance.

Target Kinematics and RCS Module
This module models the target (e.g., an aircraft) motion and radar cross section. It updates the target's position each time step based on its velocity and can simulate maneuvers. It also provides the target's RCS, including fluctuations according to Swerling models

. By default, we use a Swerling I model (RCS is constant during a dwell, but varies from dwell to dwell) with an exponential distribution for RCS values.

Explanation: The target moves with a given velocity (straight line by default). The RCS can fluctuate each radar dwell. For Swerling I/II targets, the RCS is modeled as an exponential random variable
mathworks.com
 with mean rcs_mean. (Swerling I: RCS constant during a dwell, new value each dwell; Swerling II: independent pulse-to-pulse, which our implementation also effectively supports by drawing each call.) Swerling III/IV (Chi-square 4 DOF) can be simulated by a Gamma distribution (we included a basic approach). If no model is specified, the RCS is taken as a constant rcs_mean.
RF Environment Module
This module represents the RF propagation environment, including path loss, background noise, and clutter. In free space, path loss is already accounted for in the radar equation. We include a placeholder for additional propagation effects (returning 1.0 for free-space). The environment can also provide a clutter power level or factor to simulate ground clutter. For simplicity, we model clutter as an additional noise power or a factor that raises the noise floor.

Note: In this simplified model, clutter_power raises the noise floor by a constant amount. In a real scenario, clutter would depend on radar geometry and might produce false targets at certain ranges/velocities. Here we treat it as additional noise for the detection threshold.
Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Module
This module simulates enemy electronic countermeasures (jamming). We implement a noise jammer that radiates power to interfere with the radar. The jamming power received at the missile's radar is computed and added to the radar's noise. We assume an isotropic jammer on the target (worst-case). The model calculates the received jamming power as a function of distance (inversely with $R^2$, one-way path). This reduces the missile radar’s SNR, especially at long ranges, requiring the missile to get closer for “burn-through”.

        return P_jam
Explanation: The jammer’s effectiveness is determined by its EIRP and the distance. The formula assumes the jammer’s signal is received by the radar similar to how the radar receives target echoes, but only a one-way path (hence an 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  term in the denominator instead of 
𝑅
4
R 
4
 ). The received jamming power is added to the noise in the radar receiver, reducing the SNR. A higher EIRP or greater distance (which reduces target echo faster than jam power) will degrade radar performance significantly until the missile closes in.
Sensor Fusion Module
This module fuses information from various sensors (in this case, primarily the radar seeker, possibly aided by external data) to provide an estimate of the target's state for guidance. It maintains the target's estimated position and velocity. If the radar detects the target, the fusion module updates the estimate; if the radar loses the target (no detection in a given cycle), it will predict the target position based on the last known velocity (inertial estimate). This provides some robustness against temporary loss of lock or jamming.

(The sensor fusion update is simplified. In a real system, a Kalman filter or alpha-beta filter would refine the estimates. Here we assume the missile can roughly keep track by inertial prediction if the radar lock is lost.) Usage: The fusion module should be initialized with an initial target estimate (for example, from the launch platform’s radar). Each cycle, call update() with the latest detection. The module provides target_pos_est and target_vel_est as the best-known target state for guidance. If detection is None (target not detected due to low SNR or ECM), it will propagate the last state forward, so the guidance can still try to intercept the predicted location.
Missile Dynamics Module
This module handles the missile's kinematics and applies guidance commands to update its trajectory. We simulate the missile as a point mass with a given velocity. The missile’s speed is assumed mostly constant (or with slight deceleration if needed). The guidance commands are lateral accelerations (turn rates) which change the missile’s flight direction. The missile has a maximum lateral acceleration (G-limit) and the module ensures commands are capped. The dynamics update the missile's position and velocity each time step.

Explanation: We model the missile in 2D plane. The missile can turn by applying lateral acceleration. The relation 
𝜃

=
𝑎
lat
/
𝑣
θ
˙
 =a 
lat
​
 /v is used to update the heading (where 
𝑎
lat
a 
lat
​
  is lateral acceleration and 
𝑣
v is speed). We cap the lateral acceleration at max_turn_acc (e.g., 30g). We assume the missile’s speed remains roughly constant (rocket boost phase and drag are not explicitly modeled, but one could add a deceleration or thrust term). This simplified dynamic allows the missile to maneuver while maintaining speed.
Guidance System Module
This module computes the guidance commands for the missile. We implement a Proportional Navigation (PN) guidance law, which is commonly used in air-to-air missiles. PN commands an acceleration proportional to the line-of-sight (LOS) rotation rate between the missile and target, scaled by a navigation constant N

Explanation: We calculate the line-of-sight (LOS) angle to the target and how fast this angle is changing. PN guidance uses the product of LOS rate and closing speed multiplied by a constant factor N to determine the required lateral acceleration
en.wikipedia.org
. The sign of the acceleration is chosen to reduce the LOS rotation (steer toward where the target is heading). In practice, this drives the missile to lead the target. We initialize last_LOS_angle on first call and update it every time to compute LOS_rate. This simple PN implementation assumes small time steps for accuracy of the LOS rate. The guidance output is a commanded lateral acceleration that will be fed into the missile dynamics. (If no external guidance is provided (e.g., an RL agent), this module can guide the missile autonomously. Conversely, this module could be replaced or augmented by an RL policy for advanced guidance.)
Simulation Environment (OpenAI Gym Integration)
This module integrates all components into a simulation loop and provides an interface compatible with OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning. The environment simulates each time step: updating target motion, simulating radar sensing and signal processing, updating sensor fusion, and then applying guidance to the missile. The state (observation) returned can be the relative position and velocity of the target (estimated by sensor fusion) as seen by the missile. The environment supports both autonomous (built-in guidance) and agent-controlled modes. We also incorporate SimPy to handle the timing, allowing either accelerated simulation or real-time pacing

Notes on Environment: The environment ties everything together and provides a step-by-step simulation. It uses simpy.Environment to advance the simulation clock by dt each step. If real_time is True, a RealtimeEnvironment is used so that env.run(timeout) will pause the loop to match wall-clock time

, enabling hardware or interactive testing in real-time. Observation Space: In this design, we provide the agent with the relative position and velocity of the target (in the missile-centric frame). This is derived from the sensor fusion module (or ground truth if needed as a fallback). In a more realistic scenario, the observation might be raw radar measurements (range, angle, range-rate) or filtered estimates – here we give a processed state for simplicity. Action Space: The agent controls the missile’s lateral acceleration (steering). We use a continuous action in [-1, 1] which is scaled to the missile's max acceleration in the simulation. If use_internal_guidance is True, the agent’s action is ignored and the built-in PN guidance is used instead (this allows switching between classical guidance and learned guidance easily). Reward: We assign a positive reward (+100) if the missile intercepts the target (within a certain radius), and a negative reward (-100) if the missile fails (target not intercepted by the end of the episode). Time steps could also incur a small penalty to encourage faster interception (not implemented here). Users can refine the reward shaping as needed. Fail-safes and Modularity: Each component is loosely coupled:
If the radar or signal processor were absent, the environment could be configured to use perfect information (as a stub sensor) by directly feeding target truth to sensor fusion or guidance. (In our code, we ensure a fallback to truth if needed when no detection is available.)
If the ECM module is not present, RadarSeeker simply won't add jamming noise (we check self.ecm is not None).
If sensor fusion is not desired, one could bypass it and use raw detections or truth in guidance (by adjusting the environment accordingly).
The guidance module can be swapped (for example, replacing PN with a machine-learned policy) by setting use_internal_guidance=False and letting the agent control, or by implementing a different guidance class and using it.
The environment parameters (like max_time, speeds, RCS, ECM power, clutter) can be adjusted via the config to simulate different scenarios or turned off (e.g., set ecm_power=0 to disable jamming, clutter_power=0 to disable clutter).
This modular design ensures that each subsystem (radar, signal processing, guidance, etc.) can be developed or tested in isolation and then integrated. The OpenAI Gym interface allows using stable-baselines3 or any RL library to train an agent on this environment, for example to learn advanced guidance or countermeasure tactics.
